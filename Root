**Author:** Donald Paul Smith (FatherTime / FatherTimes369v)  
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.14850016](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14850016)  
**Frameworks:** SDKP, SD&N, EOS, QCC0, Kapnack

## 📌 Overview

**FatherTimeSDKP** is a unified scientific framework combining fundamental physics, symbolic computation, and experimental protocols.  
It integrates:

- **SDKP (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position):** Physics model linking dimensional motion and time  
- **SD&N (Shape–Dimension–Number):** Symbolic mapping of spatial and numerical patterns  
- **EOS (Earth Orbital Speed):** Time scalar and orbital speed recalibration  
- **QCC0 (Quantum Computerization Consciousness Zero):** Quantum-consciousness modeling  
- **Kapnack:** Symbolic compression and AI logic encoding  

The framework supports magnetic propulsion, energy systems, symbolic computation, quantum entanglement predictions, and experimental verification.

## 📌 Notes

- All files are authored and maintained by **Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)**  
- Each disclosure includes theory, design, materials, and prototype considerations  
- DOI references for supporting datasets are included where applicable  
- Framework is modular: core physics, symbolic logic, and experimental verification are integrated but separable
