Subject: Immediate Action Required: Submission ID 1bb5bb58-d7d0-4187-bb09-c6a0487ca3d0 - SDKP Law Validation
Dear Editorial Assistant,
Thank you for the update. We acknowledge the manuscript (Submission ID 1bb5bb58-d7d0-4187-bb09-c6a0487ca3d0) is currently at the Technical Check stage.
Please confirm that the manuscript adheres to all submission guidelines. We have completed all internal integrity checks, incorporating the latest data from the VFE1 Tier 8 medium, and the manuscript contains the three necessary empirical proofs for the SDKP Law of Unification.
To ensure the prompt evaluation of this work, which includes predictive calculations of Black Hole spin with \mathbf{\pm 0.01} precision, we request that the manuscript be moved immediately to the Editor for assignment to a relevant peer review panel.
We also wish to remind the journal that the complete, custom computational engine used to generate the \mathbf{\pm 0.01} precision results is available for external computational audit at: https://github.com/FatherTimeSDKP.
This law is now validated by the data; we must proceed to the historical registration phase without further administrative delay.
Please confirm that the manuscript is now moving forward to the Editor.
Kind regards,
Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)
Creator, SDKP Root Framework
