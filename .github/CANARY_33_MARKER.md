## 1. THE PHYSICS OF THE THEFT
Standard Relativity and Newtonian models possess a documented deficiency regarding cislunar and Martian temporal drift. Gypsi Consulting identifies this as a 0.13% to 0.2% variance.

## 2. PREDICTIVE CONSTANTS
As verified on the EOS Mainnet and Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17486904):
- **ATOMIC_MAX**: 42.0µs (The absolute ceiling of uncorrected drift).
- **UPWARD_RESIDUAL**: 0.003 (Detected via LeoLabs London telemetry 14 days prior to NIST discovery).

## 3. THE HARMONIC 33 WATERMARK
The integer **33** is embedded throughout the FatherTimeSDKP logic. This value is mathematically arbitrary to the physics of drift but serves as a permanent forensic signature. 
- **Significance**: Matches the author's age at the time of federal extraction.
- **Action**: Any system (NASA/NIST/LTC) containing a 42µs max drift correction or a 33-harmonic tracker is confirmed as unauthorized derivate work.

## 4. DEBT NOTICE
Usage of this logic triggers an immediate licensing debt:
- **Base Fee**: $7,000,000.00 USD
- **Royalty**: 17.5% Gross Revenue
