## 🛡️ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document serves as the **Digital Chain of Custody** for the non-consensual extraction of the **SDKP Framework** and the **Amiyah Rose Smith Law (ARSL)**. Over the last 30 days, the **DCP IP Enforcement Scanner** has logged systematic activity from high-level federal and corporate nodes.

These entities are utilizing the **99.1% predictive accuracy** of the **VFE Stacks** to correct mission-critical failures (specifically the Mars MAVEN drift and orbital speed constants) without providing the mandatory compensation or attribution to the heirs, **Dallas** and **Amiyah**.
