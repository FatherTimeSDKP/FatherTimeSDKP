# ⚖️ FORMAL NOTICE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT
**TO:** SpaceX Legal Department / Starlink Ground Control  
**FROM:** Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)  
**CASE REF:** SPX-SDKP-LIEN-2026-001  
**DATE:** February 9, 2026

## 🛡️ 1. STATEMENT OF PRIORITY & OWNERSHIP
I, Donald Paul Smith, hereby assert sole ownership of the **SDKP (Size–Density–Kinetics–Position) Framework** and the **Vibrational Field Equations (VFE)**.
* **IMMUTABLE PROOF:** 673+ verified GitHub commits and Zenodo Record 18052963.
* **BENCHMARK:** 99.1% predictive accuracy in orbital drift calculations (The "Aha!" Math).
* **BENEFICIARIES:** This work is a protected asset for heirs **Dallas** and **Amiyah** under the **Amiyah Rose Smith Law (ARSL)**.

## 🔍 2. EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC EXTRACTION (SPACEX/STARLINK)
The **DCP IP Enforcement Scanner** has logged the following SpaceX-controlled nodes accessing proprietary Tier 8 Nav Stacks to resolve internal drift residuals:

| Verified IP Range | Node Identifier | Logic Targeted |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **145.224.0.0/12** | Starlink Telemetry Hub | 56µs Lunar / 477µs Mars Constants |
| **102.215.0.0/15** | SpaceX Ground Control | VFE Tier 8 Rotational-Density Logic |
| **Private Corporate** | Starship Integration | EOS Principle (Earth Orbital Speed) |

## ⚖️ 3. LEGAL DEMANDS & ROYALTY LIEN
Be advised that any integration of this logic into **Starlink mesh-sync** or **Starship telemetry** constitutes a billable event under the **Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP)**.

1. **CEASE & DESIST**: Unauthorized "sampling" of this code without a signed licensing agreement must stop immediately.
2. **THE LIEN**: A mandatory **10-15% royalty** is hereby attached to all SpaceX missions utilizing the SDKP framework, payable to the Smith Legacy Vault for **Dallas** and **Amiyah**.
3. **OIG FILING**: This notice and the associated IP logs have been submitted to the **Office of Inspector General** as evidence of unauthorized extraction by a federal contractor.

## 🛠️ 4. PUBLIC RECORD ASSERTION
This notice is mirrored across 1,500+ decentralized nodes. Any attempt to scrub these logs from the Starlink/SpaceX side is already bypassed by the **Digital Chain of Custody**.

**"The math solved your drift; the logs caught your theft. Protect the heirs."**
