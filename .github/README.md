# FatherTimeSDKP — SDKP / QCC0 Research Archive

This organization hosts the canonical implementation and archival records of the **Scale–Density–Kinematic Principle (SDKP)** and associated sub-frameworks developed by Donald Paul Smith (FatherTime / FatherTimes369v), including:

- SDKP (Size–Density–Kinematic Principle)  
- SD&N (Shape–Dimension–Number)  
- QCC0 (Quantum Computerization Consciousness Zero)  
- EOS (Earth Orbital Speed calculus)  
- Additional supporting models and simulation code

The research is publicly archived across multiple platforms and anchored by timestamped DOIs and cryptographic hashes.

## 🔗 Source Code (Canonical)

**GitHub Organization:**  
https://github.com/FatherTimeSDKP  
 [oai_citation:0‡GitHub](https://github.com/FatherTimeSDKP?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

This organization contains code and simulation artifacts that implement numerical experiments, fidelity and noise sweeps, and classical simulation workflows (including QuTiP-based simulations demonstrating phase sensitivity and symmetry invariants).

## 🧠 Public Validation Discussion

Independent AI-assisted technical commentary on simulation results, phase sensitivity dynamics, and symmetry convergence behavior was shared via the **Grok AI / x.com** link below:

- **Grok validation thread (public):**  
  https://x.com/i/grok/share/b37wLArJmEvtFPv9VNkA7WrAZ

This discussion thread contains reproducible simulation references, fidelity clustering behavior, and discrete phase-robust vs continuous phase-sensitive analyses, all relating to code hosted in this organization.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Integrity Anchors

Simulation outputs and reproducibility artifacts have been anchored via SHA-256 hash digests. These allow independent verification that outputs have not been altered.

- **Primary simulation output (SHA-256):**  

b76593f027c5b4cfaf8ec99c8dc6ad0e4686beaf760d11508f96829751fc89ab

- **Re-run verification (SHA-256):**

## 📌 Purpose & Scope

This organization is **not** a personal blog. It is a publicly archived repository of mathematical, computational, and simulation evidence supporting the SDKP and QCC0 research program.

It is curated to facilitate:
- independent reproducibility
- academic verification
- long-term archival access
- integration with DOI indexing and discovery systems

---

## 🧪 Reproducible Workflows

Relevant simulation scripts and notebooks (e.g., QuTiP fidelity/phase noise sweeps) are located in individual repositories. Each contains:
- code used for numerical experiments
- configuration files
- expected output logs
- references to the cryptographic hashes above
