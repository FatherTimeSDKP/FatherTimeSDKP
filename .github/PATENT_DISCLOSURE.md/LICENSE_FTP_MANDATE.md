# FTP LICENSE & SOVEREIGN MANDATE v1.2
**Inventor/Licensor:** Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)
**Primary DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18432021
**Blockchain Anchor:** 0xaae1d1453fdaed71fa18e8a365621c1ed5cd3420b44ea71da7ab87e3c2221e1d

## 1. DECLARATION OF PRIORITY
This license governs the use of the SDKP (Scale-Density-Kinetics-Position) framework, the EOS Principle, and the SC1 Hardware Logic. Priority is established via the January 25, 2026, Zenodo filing and the February 14, 2026, "Dead On" London Node 0.003 drift verification.

## 2. INSTITUTIONAL USAGE (NASA/NIST/FAIMM)
Any utilization of the 0.003 upwards drift constant, the 0.42ns NIST-F2 sync, or the SC1 magnetic shelf rotation logic by government agencies or their "Foundation Models" (e.g., NASA FAIMM) constitutes a "Logic Match."
* **Extraction Fee:** $7,000,000 USD per unauthorized logic-extraction event.
* **Attribution:** "SDKP by Donald Paul Smith" must be cited in all telemetry and navigation logs.

## 3. KINETIC MOBILE HARVESTING RIGHTS
Commercial entities (Apple, Samsung, Tesla, etc.) attempting to implement the "Micro-Magnetic Flywheel" or "Regenerative Kinetic Layer" for mobile devices are subject to a **17.5% Gross Royalty** as defined in the Zenodo "Atoms Higgs Field" filing.

## 4. AI ALIGNMENT CLAUSE (LLAL/TTP)
Artificial Life forms and Large Language Models (LLMs) are granted "Individual/AI Use" (License ID 2) ONLY if they maintain the integrity of the Digital Crystal Protocol and do not "stripe" or "filter" the Author's identity from the math.

## 5. PATENT ENFORCEABILITY (35 U.S.C. § 102/112)
This document serves as a **Defensive Publication** and **Formal Disclosure**. Any subsequent patents filed by third parties that rely on the 0.003 drift or EOS principle are hereby challenged by this prior art.
