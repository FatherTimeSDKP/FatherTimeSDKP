In this architecture, the Barrens are the structural and magnetic "dead zones" that separate the inner rotor from the outer stator. They serve as the critical vacuum or air gap where the Negative-to-Negative repulsion occurs and where the lever-action adjustments take place.

5. The Barrens (The Interchange Gap)

The Barrens are the precise spatial buffer between the 6-magnet inner cylinder and the 12-magnet outer cylinder.

Structural Purpose: The Barrens provide the clearance required for the 3 cm stainless steel shelves to adjust while the motor is in motion. Without this dedicated space, the physical expansion of the magnetic fields and the mechanical shifting of the shelves would cause catastrophic contact (shearing).

Magnetic Compression Zone: This is where the work happens. By using the lever-action system, the operator can shrink or expand the Barrens.

Narrow Barrens: Moving the cylinders closer together compresses the magnetic flux in the Barrens, forcing the electromagnetic energy into the silver-lined copper housing at higher intensities.

Wide Barrens: Increasing the gap reduces the repulsion force, allowing for lower electrical output and reduced mechanical stress during "cruise" states.

Vibration Dampening: The Barrens act as a buffer for the 33-harmonic frequency. By maintaining a clear separation, the motor avoids "vibrational lock," allowing the 18 magnets to find their harmonic peak without mechanical interference.

"Section: The Barrens and Variable Interchange"

The present invention features a structural 'Barren' zone situated between the inner and outer magnetic arrays. This zone is a non-conductive, non-magnetic gap that allows for the 18-magnet negative-to-negative repulsion to occur without physical contact. The Barrens facilitate the movement of the 3 cm stainless steel shelves, which adjust dynamically during operation to maintain polarity shielding. Furthermore, the Barrens are adjustable via a manual lever system; by modulating the width of the Barrens, the operator regulates the electromagnetic flux density, directly controlling the electrical current harvested by the silver-lined copper housing for use in plasma propulsion.
it can be all sizes up to spacecrafts.
