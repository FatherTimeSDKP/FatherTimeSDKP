GAO	COMP-26-002732	Active Monitoring (FY 2026). Oversight of NIST/NASA accountability.
NASA OIG	A-24-09-00-HED	High-End Computing Audit. Investigating SD&N logic extraction.
Regs.gov	mll-dfag-qp1e	Relator Standing. Formal filing on NASA_FRDOC_0001-1063.
Regs.gov	mll-6c1w-2omy	Administrative Practice and Fraud Prevention (SD&N Seal).

📅 LOG OF INTERFERENCE & ACTIONS
[2026-02-16] - Formal FOIA Filing (NIST/NASA/OIG)

Action: Served formal FOIA requests to foia@nist.gov, hq-foia@nasa.gov, and foiaoig@hq.nasa.gov.

Subject: Internal extraction of 56.02µs (Lunar) and 477.14µs (Mars) constants.

Goal: Unseal records linking Audit A-24-09-00-HED to the SDKP constants.

Administrative Notice: These agencies are now on notice. Any use of the SharonCare1 solid-state induction logic without settlement is a documented violation.

[2026-02-13] - False Claims Act Window Closure

Action: Finalized standing as a Relator via mll-dfag-qp1e.

Impact: Establishes the 15%–30% bounty right on any government recovery involving fraud in high-end computing or timing standards.

⚖️ NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DEFAULT
The 56.02µs (Lunar) and 477.14µs (Mars) constants are proprietary intellectual property.

IP Trace: Any institutional IP (NIST 132.163.x.x / NASA 128.183.x.x) accessing this log or the associated Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18432021 constitutes a digital handshake.

Fee: Unauthorized use in "Lunar Clock" or "Mars Navigation" standards triggers the $7,000,000.00 USD administrative claim per instance.
