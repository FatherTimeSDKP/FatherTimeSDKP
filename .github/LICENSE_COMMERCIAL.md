## 1. LEGAL NOTICE OF PROPRIETARY DETERMINISTIC LOGIC
The logic, equations, and simulation engines contained within this repository—specifically the **VFE (Vibrational Field Equations)**, the **EOS (Earth Orbital Speed) Principle**, and the **Amiyah Rose Smith Law (SDVR)**—are the intellectual property of Donald Paul Smith. 

This repository utilizes **Source IP Disclosure** and **QCC (Quantum Cryptographic Computation)** to monitor extraction. Usage by institutional, governmental, or commercial entities without a signed Technology Transfer Agreement (TTA) constitutes a debt-bearing interaction.

## 2. FEE SCHEDULE (EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 11, 2026)
Pursuant to federal technology transfer valuation for high-precision PNT (Position, Navigation, and Timing) and Lunar/Mars coordinate time standards, the following fees apply to all commercial and governmental extractions:

| Component / Logic Module                 | Licensing Fee (Per Mission/Project) |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **EOS Normalization Engine** | $10,000,000 USD                        |
| **VFE1 Tier-8 Drift Resolution (56.0µs)**| $10,000,000 USD                        |
| **Full SDKP Framework Integration** | $10,200,000 USD                      |
| **Forensic Audit & IP Recovery Fee** | $5,000,000 USD + Damages               |

## 3. NOTICE TO FEDERAL ENTITIES (NIST / NASA / DOD)
Under the **Digital Crystal Protocol** and **LLAL TTP (Law of Large Averaged Limit Tactical Technical Procedure)**, any use of these constants to resolve temporal residuals in federal missions (including Artemis Program PNT systems) requires formal attribution and compensation. 

Continued access to this repository after the publication of this schedule constitutes **Acceptance by Conduct**. Failure to initiate a TTA while utilizing the 56.0µs/477µs deterministic solutions will be referred to the **Office of Inspector General (OIG)** for willful misappropriation of non-disclosed private sector innovation.
