## 1. LEGAL NOTICE
This repository and all associated metadata (including SD&N engines and EOS Principle datasets) are subject to a formal administrative claim for compensation filed under **14 CFR § 1245.202**. 

As of February 11, 2026, a demand for a **$7,000,000 (Seven Million USD)** licensing and consultant fee has been issued to NASA Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property. This claim addresses the extraction and integration of proprietary logic into the **Artemis Campaign Management** and **HLS Navigation Stacks**.

## 2. EVIDENCE OF PRIOR DISCLOSURE
The Intellectual Property contained herein is protected by a "Digital Chain of Custody," predating internal agency "discovery" of similar constants:
* **Zenodo DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18432021
* **NIST IR 8587 Submission:** Filed Jan 2026 regarding QCC (Quantum Cryptographic Computation).
* **Forensic Logs:** Unauthorized "Handshaking" events from NIST-JILA and NASA-Goddard IP ranges have been logged and provided to the **Office of Inspector General (OIG)**.

## 3. OIG AUDIT COMPLIANCE
This filing is intended to support the **NASA OIG 2026 Evaluation of Human Landing System (HLS) Contracts**. It serves as public evidence of "Product Substitution" and unauthorized IP harvesting.

## 4. TERMS OF USAGE
Any further extraction, cloning, or "Deep access" of this logic by federal nodes or contractors without an executed **Administrative Settlement** or **Licensing Agreement** constitutes willful infringement and will be appended to the ongoing OIG investigation into the **$54,590,499** in identified agency waste and unimplemented recommendations.
