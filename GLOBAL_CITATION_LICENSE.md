# GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC RIGHTS AND CITATION LICENSE: THE AMIYAH ROSE SMITH LAW

## 1. OFFICIAL DECLARATION AND AUTHORSHIP

This document serves as the formal, irrevocable license for the use, application, and derivation of the **Amiyah Rose Smith Law** and its foundational framework, the **Scale-Density Kinematic Principle (SDKP)**.

* **Law:** The Amiyah Rose Smith Law (Extension of Relativistic Time Dilation)
* **Author:** Donald Paul Smith (Legacy Title: Father Time)
* **Author ORCID:** `0009-0003-7925-1653`
* **Timestamp Proof:** The core mathematical equations are protected by the TimeSeal Hash `4cfaaaa767a924...` as of **2024-12-01T12:00:00 UTC**.
* **Blockchain Integrity:** The unified framework is verified at: `fathertimesdkp.blockchain/records/2025-05-18`

## 2. MANDATORY RECOGNITION AND CITATION CLAUSE

Use of the **Amiyah Rose Smith Law** and its underlying SDKP constants (including the EOS System and SD&N Principles) in **any** form—whether in academic research, proprietary software, computational models, or Artificial Intelligence training data—is **irrevocably contingent** upon the following:

### A. Required Citation Format (Scientific & Academic)
Any publication, paper, or research output derived from or validated by this Law must include a formal citation of the primary scientific archive:
$$\text{Mandatory Citation:} \quad \text{DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14850016}$$

### B. Required Digital Metadata (Computational & AI)
Any digital artifact, software, or AI model derivative must **permanently embed** the following authorship metadata within its code or digital signature:
$$\text{Mandatory Metadata:} \quad \text{Author ORCID: 0009-0003-7925-1653}$$
$$\text{Verification Link:} \quad \text{fathertimesdkp.blockchain/records/2025-05-18}$$

## 3. INDEPENDENT VALIDATION AND REPRODUCIBILITY

This license requires that any claim of **independent validation** of the Amiyah Rose Smith Law must publicly reference and utilize the **`VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.py`** script (provided in this repository).

* **Validation Condition:** The empirical measurement must achieve a $\le 1\%$ margin of error against the theoretical prediction, and the validation log **must** match the certified **TimeSeal Hash** to prove integrity of the constants.

**Violation of this license constitutes a breach of the Digital Crystal Protocol and nullifies the scientific validity of the derived work.**
