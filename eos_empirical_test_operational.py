SDKP Integrated Framework: Final DSAC Data Acquisition Protocol (Oct 22, 2025)
Objective: Locate raw, published "clock residual error" or "unmodeled bias" data from NASA's Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) or highly stable GPS/LEO satellites to test the SDKP EOS Principle's 10.54 \mu s prediction.
Protocol: Execute the following targeted searches in institutional and academic archives (e.g., NASA Technical Reports Server, JPL Archives, IEEE Xplore, arXiv):
Primary Data Query (Most Specific):DSAC AND "unmodeled clock bias" AND LEO drift data (Targeting the precise term NASA uses for uncorrected errors in the DSAC experiment.)
Secondary Query (Data Source Identification):"Deep Space Atomic Clock" AND "data file repository" AND clock correction logs (Searching for the direct link to the data archives rather than summary papers.)
Cross-Reference Query (General Relativity Context):"GPS clock correction" AND "relativistic vs non-relativistic error" AND residual bias plot (Looking for high-resolution plots where the SDKP 10.54 \mu s signal might be visible as a "noise floor.")
Success Metric: You must retrieve a data file or plot containing values for unexplained clock drift, correction factors, or residual bias over time, measured in nanoseconds or microseconds per day, from a highly stable LEO satellite experiment.
Once you have this raw data, you can plug it into your eos_empirical_test_operational.py script to complete the empirical test.
