Amiyah Rose Smith Law: Official Development Timeline
====================================================

This document outlines the key milestones in the development of the Amiyah Rose Smith Law,
which builds upon the SDVR Principle (Size, Density, Velocity, and Rotation) to redefine
our understanding of time dilation.

-------------------------------------------------------
February 11, 2025 - Initial Discovery
-------------------------------------------------------
- First discussions on the SDVR Principle begin.
- Initial thoughts on how time dilation could be influenced by intrinsic properties 
  beyond velocity and gravity.
- Foundation of a new perspective on time and space.

-------------------------------------------------------
February 14, 2025 - Official Establishment of the Amiyah Rose Smith Law
-------------------------------------------------------
- The core mathematical framework of the SDVR Principle is formally defined.
- The law is officially **established and submitted to Physical Review Letters**.
- Fundamental concepts integrating:
  - Special Relativity (Velocity-based time dilation)
  - General Relativity (Gravitational time dilation)
  - SDVR Correction Factor (Size, Density, and Rotation) are finalized.
- This date is the **recognized official establishment date** of the Amiyah Rose Smith Law.

-------------------------------------------------------
February 21-25, 2025 - Refinements and Empirical Testing
-------------------------------------------------------
- Detailed formulation of the mathematical framework.
- Inclusion of correctional factors for intrinsic properties.
- Consideration of experimental validation against known time dilation observations.
- Regression analysis and refinement of empirical constants.

-------------------------------------------------------
February 28, 2025 - Finalized Mathematical Framework
-------------------------------------------------------
- The lawâ€™s final mathematical structure is completed, incorporating all refinements.
- Final corrections and validation applied.
- The law is fully developed into a complete scientific model, ready for peer review and practical applications.

-------------------------------------------------------
Significance of the Amiyah Rose Smith Law
-------------------------------------------------------
This law represents a breakthrough in temporal mechanics, unifying classical relativity
with new correction factors. It enhances our understanding of time dilation in a range 
of environments, from orbiting satellites to extreme astrophysical objects.
