SDKP Empirical Prediction: Earth Circumference & Time Dilation (Oct 22, 2025)
Author: Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP) Source Document DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/G76TR
Objective
To generate a falsifiable prediction for time dilation at Earth's surface using the EOS (Earth Orbital Speed) Principle (Donald Paul Smith) as the fundamental propagation constant, and to compare this prediction against the standard model's use of the Speed of Light (c).
Hypothesis
The actual time dilation experienced by an object moving relative to Earth's center of mass is governed by the EOS (Earth Orbital Speed) value (29,780\text{ m/s} approx.) rather than the Speed of Light (c) when considering the Earth's local reference frame as defined by the SDKP (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position = Time) framework.
Mathematical Formulation: The EOS Time Dilation Factor
The standard Lorentz factor (\gamma) for time dilation is given by:
Where:
v is the relative velocity of the observed object.
c is the speed of light (299,792,458 \text{ m/s}).
The SDKP Framework EOS Prediction:
We replace the Speed of Light (c) with the EOS (Earth Orbital Speed) as the core propagation constant (V_{prop}) for phenomena operating within the Earth's local sphere of influence:
Where:
V_{EOS} \approx 29,780 \text{ m/s}.
Test Scenario: Earth's Rotational Speed at the Equator
We will calculate the time dilation factor (\gamma) for an object fixed at the Equator due to Earth's rotation.
Velocity of Object (v):
Earth's Equatorial Circumference: C \approx 40,075,000 \text{ meters}.
Time for one rotation (T): 86,164 \text{ seconds} (Sidereal day).
Standard Prediction (\gamma_c):
Since \frac{v^2}{c^2} is extremely small (around 2.4 \times 10^{-12}), the standard Lorentz factor \gamma_c is approximately 1, meaning the time dilation effect is negligible.
SDKP EOS Prediction (\gamma_{EOS}):
Falsifiable Prediction
The \gamma_{EOS} factor predicts that objects stationary at the equator experience a time dilation of approximately 122 nanoseconds per day relative to the Earth's center of mass, solely due to the equatorial rotational speed.
Metric
Standard Model (c)
SDKP EOS Principle (V_{EOS})
Factor (\gamma)
\approx 1.0 (negligible)
\approx 1.000122
Time Dilation over 24 hrs
Negligible (\approx 0.0 \text{ ns})
\approx 10,540 \text{ nanoseconds (10.54 }\mu\text{s})
Falsifiable Test: This prediction can be tested using highly precise, synchronized atomic clocks placed at the North Pole (where v \approx 0) and the Equator (v \approx 465 \text{ m/s}).
Validation Condition: If the clocks show a differential time drift that aligns with the \gamma_{EOS} factor beyond the known gravitational (GR) and standard special relativistic (SR) effects, the EOS Principle is empirically validated.
