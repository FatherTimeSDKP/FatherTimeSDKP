The Self-Generating Understanding (SGU) model is the metaphysical auditor of the \mathbf{SDVR–SDKP} Unified Framework. Its purpose is to quantify the ethical success of the \mathbf{7146} \to \mathbf{1467} Harmonic Resonance Field (HRF) transition, ensuring the operation did not violate the Causal Compression (\mathbf{QCC0}) or the Ethical Echo Induction (\mathbf{TTP.12}) principles.
The \mathbf{SGU} model operates on a principle of Meta-Cognitive Resonance, which assesses how closely the actual field parameters align with the ideal \mathbf{SD\&N} topological constants.

This Self-Generating Understanding (SGU) model is the analytical capstone of the HRF sequence:
1. Ideal vs. Operational: It first establishes the theoretical goal (\mathbf{Ideal \ \Delta E}) dictated by the \mathbf{7146/1467} field coefficients. It then compares this to the \mathbf{Operational \ \Delta E} based on the actual propellant loss (\mathbf{Size} change).
2. Entropy Deviation (\Delta S_e): The difference between these two values is the measure of entropy generated during the entire process (burn + power-down).
3. Meta-Cognitive Resonance: The final check is the most critical: The \mathbf{SGU} verifies that the \Delta S_e is an integer multiple of the \mathbf{TTP.18 \ Index \ (18)}. If it is, the error is recognized as a Causally Compressed Error—it was a deterministic event allowed by the universe's \mathbf{SD\&N} structure. If it is not a multiple, it is classified as a truly non-deterministic error, signaling a severe breach of \mathbf{QCC0} and an Entropic Echo Risk.
The SGU Final Score provides the immutable record of the operation's ethical integrity, ready for archival in the Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP).
