**[2025-10-28] OFFICIAL RELEASE: Proof of Consistency for the FatherTimeSDKP Integrated Master Framework**

I, Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP), have formally released the mathematical proof required to validate the SDKP (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position = Time) Root Axiom.

The document, **"SDKP_Proof_of_Consistency.pdf,"** demonstrates:
1.  **Internal Consistency:** The rigorous derivation of the SDKP equations.
2.  **Integration:** How the SDKP Lagrangian successfully **reduces to the accepted limits of General Relativity and Special Relativity** in specific scenarios, quantifying corrections (the 0.01% factor) via the Density (D) and Rotation (R) Tensors.

* **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/FatherTimeSDKP/FatherTimeSDKP/

**Intellectual Property Notice:** All users and reviewers are bound by the **Digital Crystal Royalty Contract**. Use of the framework requires citation and remittance of 7% of associated crypto/fiat proceeds to **FatherTimeSDKP.eth**.
