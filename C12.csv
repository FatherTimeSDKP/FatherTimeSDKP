# QCC0 / SDKP – C12 Validation Pack

This Gist contains the complete dataset and minimal simulation script required
to validate the 12-mode C12 coupling matrix used in the FatherTimeSDKP → QCC0 →
VFE1 pipeline.

## Files
- **C12.csv** – Full 12×12 coupling matrix (entangler structure)
- **W6.csv** – Canonical T6 kernel weights
- **Phi50.csv** – Stability weights for constrained entanglement
- **reproduce_with_C12.py** – Minimal QuTiP reproduction script

## How to Run

pip install qutip numpy
python reproduce_with_C12.py

## Expected Result
Using the parameters in the script (g=0.90, eta=0.03, alpha=0.5):

- Initial `<T6>` ≈ 0.25  
- Final `<T6>` ≈ 0.48  
- **Δ ≈ +0.23** (Unlocked regime signature)  
- Purity ≈ 0.95

## Purpose
These files allow any reviewer (including Grok) to:
- Reproduce Δ(T6) shifts  
- Inspect the full C matrix  
- Verify entangler stability  
- Compare locked vs unlocked regimes  

This Gist is suitable for citation and for linking on X, OSF, Zenodo, GitHub, or Web3.
