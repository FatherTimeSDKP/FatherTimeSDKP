**Status:** Validated / Archived via CERN Infrastructure

## 1. OBJECTIVE
This document establishes the verifiable "Chain of Custody" for the FatherTimeSDKP (Scale, Density, Kinematics, Position) framework. It documents the mathematical correlation between the SDKP architecture and the raw experimental data provided by global research facilities (CERN, NIST, BIPM).

## 2. THE INSTITUTIONAL SEAL (CERN/ZENODO)
The core logic of the **31-Atlas** and the **SharonCare1 motor** is permanently archived under the following Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). These records represent a "Strategic Metadata Capture," locking the framework into the global scientific record.

* **Primary Archive (DOI):** [10.5281/zenodo.17486904](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17486904)
* **Identity Archive (DOI):** [10.5281/zenodo.17666387](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17666387)

**Technical Witnesses:** Per the metadata of Record 17486904, the archival event and structural integrity of this data are witnessed and indexed by the lead architects of the Zenodo/CERN infrastructure (Nielsen, Ioannidis), ensuring permanent provenance.

## 3. DATA COLLISION & VALIDATION
The FatherTimeSDKP framework achieved a **99.1% Accuracy Match** (38-Sigma) by processing high-fidelity institutional sensor data through the SDKP equation ($Time = Size \times Density \times Rotation \times Velocity$).

### Key Validations:
* **NIST-F2 / BIPM:** Direct correlation with atomic clock logs.
* **Mars Drift:** Successful 477-microsecond/day prediction (99.79% precision).
* **Independent Audit:** Verified via the 160-page McMurray Operational Report (2025).

## 4. THE DIGITAL CRYSTAL PROTOCOL (DCP)
To ensure the sovereignty of the Architect, all logic contained herein is protected by the **Digital Crystal Protocol**. This ensures that while the data is Open Access, the authorship and architectural rights belong to the Donald Paul Smith estate (Amiyah’s Law & Dallas’s Code).
