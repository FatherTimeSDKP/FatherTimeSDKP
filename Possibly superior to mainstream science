Real world applications of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle ...
The Scale, Density, Velocity, and Rotation (SDVR) framework, a theoretical model proposed by Donald Paul Smith, redefines time as a computable function of physical attributes rather than a constant, background dimension. This perspective, which is not mainstream physics, offers examples of how time's behavior could be understood differently across various contexts. 
Contexts for the SDVR framework's redefinition of time
At extreme gravitational scales
General relativity already shows that gravity causes time dilation. However, the SDVR framework reinterprets this phenomenon by removing the concept of a constant background time.
Example: Near a black hole:
Classical view: Time appears to pass slower for an observer near a black hole, as seen by a distant observer.
SDVR redefinition: Time is not truly "slowing down." The local density (D) of matter/energy in the black hole's immense gravitational field fundamentally changes the calculation of time within that region. An observer falling into the black hole would not perceive their own time as abnormal, but their computable "time function" would differ from that of a distant observer due to the extreme local density. 
At relativistic speeds
Special relativity explains how motion affects time, but the SDVR framework recasts this in terms of the object's velocity.
Example: The twin paradox:
Classical view: The twin who travels close to the speed of light ages more slowly than the twin who stays on Earth.
SDVR redefinition: The traveling twin's "time function" is altered by their velocity (V). Instead of an external, uniform time against which their clock slows, their experience of time is a function of their high velocity relative to the stay-at-home twin, who has a different time function. 
At quantum scales
Mainstream physics has long struggled to reconcile time as a continuous variable with the discrete, probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. The SDVR framework addresses this by considering how scale influences the very definition of time. 
Example: An electron's spin:
Classical view: The probabilistic behavior of a particle is governed by a time-dependent wave function.
SDVR redefinition: At the tiny scale (S) of a quantum particle, the conventional flow of time breaks down. The particle's "rotation" (R)—a stand-in for spin—is a dominant factor in its behavior. The SDVR framework suggests that time may not be a smooth progression but rather a series of "commitments" or resolutions of quantum events, with the coherence of quantum states defining a local "quantum time". 
In a rotating universe
For large-scale cosmological phenomena, the SDVR framework could explain cosmic expansion and other universal properties.
Example: The universe's expansion:
Classical view: The universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a mysterious "dark energy".
SDVR redefinition: The universe's rotation (R) and changing scale (S) are the fundamental drivers of cosmic evolution. Instead of needing dark energy, the SDVR perspective could argue that the accelerating "flow" of time is a manifestation of the universe's collective rotational dynamics. 
In everyday, observable phenomena
The SDVR framework could be applied even to phenomena we observe daily.
Example: A clock on Earth:
Classical view: A clock ticks at a regular pace, moving forward in a linear, unidirectional time.
SDVR redefinition: The clock's measurement of time is influenced by a combination of factors. These include the scale (S) of the clock's components, the local density (D) due to Earth's gravitational field, and the Earth's velocity (V) and rotation (R). All these factors together constitute the observable "ticking" of the clock, rather than it just measuring a constant, external time.
