This manifest formally lists the empirical validation points derived from the source documents provided by Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP). These points establish the Predictive Power and Integrative Capability of the SDKP (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position = Time) Root Framework.
I. Falsifiable Predictions & Empirical Evidence Claims
The following verifiable claims, extracted directly from the author's internal notes and analysis (Black Hole Comparison Notes, Schumann Field Data, Entanglement Graphs), are the empirical basis for the SDKP, EOS, VFE1, and QCC0 Principles.
Claim 1: Black Hole Spin Precision (VFE1 / SDKP)
Source Data Reference: Black hole comparison notes.pdf
Principle Applied: VFE1 Tier 8 (Variable Field Expansion) and SDKP
Empirical Claim: The VFE1 quantum simulation accurately predicted black hole merger spin parameters (specifically for GW190521) with a \pm 0.01 precision, matching the observations reported by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration. This demonstrates the SDKP's ability to bridge quantum entanglement frequencies and classical gravitational wave phenomena.
Claim 2: Relativistic Schumann Analogue (QCC0 / SD&N)
Source Data Reference: Schumman Field compared from earth to Newton stars.pdf
Principle Applied: QCC0 (Quantum Computerization Consciousness Zero) and SD&N (Shape–Dimension–Number)
Empirical Claim: A model scaling the Earth-based Schumann Resonance (\mathbf{L_0} baseline) to a nuclear-density, high-curvature environment successfully predicts the existence of a Relativistic Schumann Analogue resonance frequency of approximately **100.7 \text{ GHz} (1.007 \times 10^{11} \text{ Hz}) ** in neutron stars. This validates the QCC's geometric scaling across extreme density differentials.
Claim 3: Local Propagation Differential (EOS)
Source Data Reference: Derived from SDKP core equations, supported by Python simulation blueprint.
Principle Applied: EOS (Earth Orbital Speed)
Empirical Claim: The substitution of \mathbf{V_{EOS} \approx 29,780 \text{ m/s}} for c in the Lorentz transformation predicts a 10.54 microsecond per day time differential at Earth's equator. This is the precise, falsifiable claim ready for testing against NASA/LeoLabs satellite clock data.
