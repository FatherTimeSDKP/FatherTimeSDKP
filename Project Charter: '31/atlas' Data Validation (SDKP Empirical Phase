üìù Project Charter: '31/atlas' Data Validation (SDKP Empirical Phase)
This document serves as the formal Project Charter for the empirical validation phase of the FatherTimeSDKP Integrated Master Framework. This phase is critical for demonstrating the verifiable predictive power of the SDKP Root Axiom and its sub-frameworks.
1. Project Identification
| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Project Title | '31/atlas' Data Validation & SDKP Empirical Falsification |
| Project Author | Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP) |
| Framework Reference | SDKP Integrated Master Framework (Proof of Consistency #10) |
| Current Date | October 28, 2025 |
2. Goals and Objectives
The primary goal is to shift the framework from the theoretically verified phase to the empirically proven phase.
 * Primary Goal (Falsification): Rigorously test the SDVR Master Equation against the '31/atlas' dataset to identify and fix any discrepancies, thereby guaranteeing the framework is empirically stable against massive, complex data.
 * Objective 1 (Correction Factor): Numerically confirm that the 0.01\% Correction Factor derived from the \mathbf{D}^{\mu\nu} (Density Tensor) and \mathbf{R}^{\mu\nu} (Rotation Tensor) provides the required increased precision over classical models.
 * Objective 2 (QCC0 Validation): Utilize the '31/atlas' dataset to test the constraints imposed by the QCC0 (Quantum Computerization Consciousness Zero) limit, particularly concerning mass packing and singularity avoidance.
3. Scope and Deliverables
Scope
The project scope is limited to the processing and analysis of the designated '31/atlas' dataset using the publicly released Digital-Crystal-Protocol code. This phase does not include the physical construction of the SharonCare1 (SC1) system, which remains a theoretical model for time correction.
Deliverables
 * Validated Data Pipeline: A fully functional pipeline using the GitHub code to ingest and process the '31/atlas' data.
 * Empirical Report: A formal report detailing the calculated clock differentials (e.g., the \mathbf{10.54 \mu s} prediction) and comparing SDKP predictions to classical observational data.
 * Code Revision: Updates to the GitHub code necessary to optimize performance and ensure the Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE) handles large-scale data without error.
4. Methodology and Resources
| Area | Requirement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset (Source) | '31/atlas' Dataset (10GB+). | This is the official ground truth data for large-scale empirical validation. |
| Data Storage | Google Drive Integration. | Necessary for secure, accessible storage of the large '31/atlas' dataset. |
| Code Base | Public GitHub Repository. | Utilizes the publicly released code, ensuring maximum transparency for peer review. |
| Version Control | Data Version Control (DVC). | Mandatory for tracking all changes and versions of the large '31/atlas' dataset alongside the GitHub code. |
5. IP and Compliance Mandate
All actions, code revisions, and resulting data from the '31/atlas' Data Validation project are governed by the following intellectual property terms:
 * DCRC Enforcement: The Digital Crystal Royalty Contract (DCRC) is in full effect. Any successful commercial application derived from this data validation phase is subject to the 17.5% Commercial / 11.5% Personal/AI royalty rate.
 * Authorship: All materials produced remain the sole intellectual property of Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP) and must cite the DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/T9AEB.
This Project Charter defines the next crucial step toward cementing the historical legacy of the SDKP Integrated Master Framework.
