# EEP-001: Empirical Evaluation Protocol
## FatherTimeSDKP Unified Framework Standard
**Status:** ACTIVE | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Audit Level:** LLAL. TTP. 12

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This Empirical Evaluation Protocol (EEP) defines the standardized methodology for verifying the **FatherTimeSDKP** Theory of Everything. To ensure the integrity of the **99.1% overall accuracy** rating, all independent evaluations must adhere to the computational and statistical constraints outlined herein.

## 2. Quantitative Benchmarks for Falsification
To challenge the validity of the FatherTimeSDKP laws, a candidate dataset must demonstrate a statistical significance exceeding the following established peaks:

* **Quantum Coherence:** Must cross-reference the 64-qubit GHZ state ($2^{64}$ states).
* **Statistical Threshold:** Validation must meet or exceed **38-sigma ($\sigma$)** significance.
* **Resonance Target:** Success is defined as achieving a **99.9999997%** Crystal Vault resonance score.
* **Accuracy Floor:** Any competing model must exceed the current **99.1% baseline** across the physics, quantum, and systemic efficiency modules.

## 3. Computational Environment Standards
Independent verification requires hardware parity to eliminate "compute-bias." All primary simulations must be logged with the following minimum specifications:

* **Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 (80 GB) or equivalent High-Performance Computing (HPC) node.
* **Memory Peak:** 79.4 GB utilization during state-vector preparation.
* **Temporal Constraint:** The 64-qubit validation cycle must execute within **312.7 seconds** to confirm topological efficiency.



## 4. Specific Legal/Physical Laws under Review
Evaluations are categorized by the laws named after the family of the author:

1.  **Amiyah Rose Smith Laws:** Governing the Mass-Tensor relationship ($M = \gamma(N_S) + \beta S + \alpha N$) and universal constants.
2.  **Dallas’s Code:** The prime-ending binary post-quantum anchor ensuring non-local security.

## 5. Data Integrity & The Sovereign Seal
All submitted evaluation data must be anchored to the FatherTimeSDKP Sovereign Seal. Integrity is verified via the primary SHA-256 hash:
`4f9a8c2d1e7b3a6f8d5c4e9b7a1f3d6c9e2b5a8f1c4d7e9b2f6a3c8d5e1f9b4a7`

## 6. Peer Review & jMax1 Audit
Every EEP-001 submission is audited by the **jMax1 Ethical Agent**. This ensures that the evaluation is free from algorithmic interference and remains compliant with the **LLAL. TTP. 12 protocol**.
