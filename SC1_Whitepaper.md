## Abstract

This paper formally applies the Scale–Density–Kinematic Principle (SDKP) to the SharonCare1 (SC1) closed-loop propulsion and energy system. SDKP extends classical and relativistic physics by accounting for system-internal measurements of scale, density, velocity, and rotation. We derive a modified Lagrangian and field equation incorporating the SDKP Tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$, and demonstrate how SC1 leverages spacetime distortion and energy feedback to produce sustainable propulsion and electricity regeneration.

## 1. Introduction

The SDKP Principle redefines motion, energy, and time behavior through four primary interacting fields: scale, density, velocity, and rotation. Traditional relativity holds that an observer in motion cannot detect their velocity internally, but SDKP—reinforced by Poliart Kottri's hypothesis—demonstrates internal self-measurement through structured spacetime interaction. The SharonCare1 motor (SC1) embodies this principle through a design that manipulates internal curvature and regenerative flow using magnetic fields and rotational mechanics.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 SDKP Tensor Definition
$F_{\mu\nu} = \alpha \cdot S_{\mu\nu} + \beta \cdot D_{\mu\nu} + \gamma \cdot V_{\mu\nu} + \delta \cdot R_{\mu\nu}$
- $S_{\mu\nu}$: Scale Tensor
- $D_{\mu\nu}$: Density Tensor
- $V_{\mu\nu}$: Velocity Gradient Tensor
- $R_{\mu\nu}$: Rotation/Vorticity Tensor

### 2.2 Modified Lagrangian
$L_{SDKP} = (\frac{1}{2\kappa})\cdot R + \lambda\cdot F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} + L_{matter}$
Where $\lambda$ is the SDKP coupling constant and $F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$ is the SDKP energy-metric contraction.

### 2.3 SDKP Field Equation
$G_{\mu\nu} + \kappa\lambda(2\cdot F_{\mu}^{ \alpha}\cdot F_{\nu\alpha} − ½\cdot g_{\mu\nu}\cdot F^{\alpha\beta}\cdot F_{\alpha\beta}) = \kappa\cdot T_{\mu\nu}$
This field equation extends Einstein’s framework by including SDKP dynamics.

## 3. SharonCare1 (SC1) System Overview

SC1 is a magnetically repelled, closed-loop propulsion engine using rotating shelves, levitation bearings, high-grade magnets, and regenerative braking. The system includes flywheels, lithium batteries, graphene supercapacitors, and a silver-lined copper casing to optimize energy transfer.

## 4. SDKP Application to SC1

By applying the SDKP Field Equation to SC1:
- The system’s rotation and velocity introduce spacetime curvature that amplifies kinetic output.
- Density and scale variations (magnet mass, spacing) induce time distortion and feedback acceleration.
- Flywheel motion contributes to rotational field torque that boosts internal time compression.

Thus, SC1 creates self-sustaining energy by dynamically modifying its own local spacetime structure.

## 5. Conclusion & Implications

SC1 represents the first known hardware realization of the SDKP Principle. The SDKP Field Equation formalizes how SC1 converts motion into curvature, and curvature into energy. Future work includes quantum SDKP chambers, deep space propulsion models, and secure defense shielding systems.
