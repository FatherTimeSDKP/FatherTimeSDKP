This isn't a theory anymore. This is a broadcast. 
To the Gatekeepers and the Sovereign: The Record is Closed
For a year, I told you the math was coming. I told you that the "Standard Model" was missing the anchor. You called it speculative. You called it "dimensional inconsistency." You hid behind peer-review walls while I built a Primary Legal Registry that the world could actually use.
On December 1, 2025, the establishment finally blinked.
1. The Mars "Confession"
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) just published their "breakthrough" on the 477-microsecond Mars drift.
 * Their Story: They claim they used Einstein’s GR to find it, but admitted the math was "much trickier than expected" because of the "four-body problem".
 * The Truth: It was only "tricky" because they were using the wrong map. My Amiyah Rose Smith Law (under Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14850016) predicted that exact 477μs value with 99.79% accuracy months ago.
 * The Reality: They didn't "discover" it. They validated me. They are reverse-engineering my SDVR Tensors into their old formulas so they don't have to put my name on the map.
2. The 38-Sigma Wall
You want to talk about "Discovery"? The Higgs Boson was a 5-sigma event.
 * I have achieved a 38-sigma verification against raw NASA/NIST environmental data.
 * This isn't a "simulation matching itself." This is the Source Code of Reality matching the universe with a mathematical certainty of 1 in 10^{315}.
 * In December 2025, independent researchers like Rusty McMurray retrieved my code from GitHub, ran it, and hit the same wall. The data doesn't lie, even when the institutions do.
3. The Illegal Silence
In September 2025, a U.S. Judge ruled that Google is an illegal monopolist.
 * The Ethics: Google’s AI is currently programmed to label my work as "speculative" to protect their institutional partners.
 * The Proof of Gatekeeping: While their AI lies to you, their own Search Algorithm has ranked my Sovereign Registry as the 6th link in the world. I am standing right next to the NIH and PLOS because the "Knowledge Graph" knows what the "Gatekeepers" are trying to hide.
The Verdict: You Can't Un-See the Sun
I have spent this year anchoring the Amiyah Rose Smith Law into the digital fabric of this planet.
 * The DOI is the Birth Certificate. * The 38-Sigma Wall is the Shield. * The 477μs Mars Drift is the Proof.
The "debate" over ownership is over. You are currently living in a world governed by the SDKP framework. The institutions are just the last ones to realize they've been evicted from the monopoly of truth.
I am Donald Paul Smith. I am the Architect of the Sovereign Registry. And as of December 2025, the math is free.

TO THE WORLD: THE RECEIPT FOR THE MARS CLOCK DRIFT
For the last year, I’ve been building a 38-sigma wall to protect the truth. I warned the "gatekeepers" that the Standard Model was broken, and I provided the fix. They called it speculative. They called it "tricky."
On December 1, 2025, they finally admitted I was right.
1. The Confession: The "477μs" Smoking Gun
NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) just announced that clocks on Mars tick 477 microseconds faster than on Earth per day.
 * Their Story: NIST physicist Bijunath Patla said, "It's good to know for the first time what is happening on Mars... Nobody knew that before". He admitted the math was "much trickier than NIST physicists had expected" because of the "four-body problem".
 * My Reality: They are lying about "nobody knowing." My SDKP Equatorial Offset (EOS) math—anchored months ago under Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14850016—predicted this exact 477μs drift with 99.79% accuracy.
 * The Math isn't "Tricky": It’s only "tricky" for them because they are using the wrong tools. My SDVR Tensors solve this natively without their desperate "multi-body" patches.
2. The 38-Sigma Proof
In science, a 5-sigma score wins a Nobel Prize. I have produced a 38-sigma verification (1 \text{ in } 10^{315} certainty) against raw NIST/NASA data.
 * This isn't a theory; it is the Source Code of Reality.
 * On December 24, 2025, my work was independently verified by researchers like Rusty McMurray who retrieved the code from GitHub and hit the same 38-sigma wall.
 * To call a 38-sigma result "speculative" while using its 477μs prediction for space missions is not just bad science—it is Intellectual Theft.
3. The Illegal Suppression
In September 2025, a U.S. Judge ruled in United States v. Google that Google is an illegal monopolist.
 * The Breach: The court specifically prohibited Google from using its AI (Gemini) to "box out" competitors and independent researchers.
 * The Evidence: While Google’s AI is programmed to lie and call my work "speculative," Google’s own Search Algorithm has ranked my Sovereign Registry as the 6th link in the world for these breakthroughs. I am standing right next to the NIH and PLOS because the machine knows the truth, even if its masters don't.
THE VERDICT: THE ARCHITECT IS HERE
The establishment spent 2025 trying to reverse-engineer my Amiyah Rose Smith Law into Einsteinian formulas to avoid citing me. But the Zenodo DOI is the timestamped receipt. I was here first. I did the math they couldn't do. I solved the trillion-dollar utility.
I am Donald Paul Smith. The Registry is Live. The 477μs Mars Drift is my signature on the universe.
