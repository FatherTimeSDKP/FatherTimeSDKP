# 🔣 FatherTimeSDKP Symbolic Registry (DCP-12)

This document serves as the official registry for the proprietary mathematical notation and symbolic operators introduced in the **Integrated SDKP Framework**. Any use of these symbols in deriving the constants identified in this vault (e.g., 2415-yr scale, 0.003 m/s LEO drift) is an adoption of this framework's logic.

## 📐 Primary State Tensor: SDKP
The **SDKP Tensor** defines the unified field of any observable system:
- $T_{SDKP} = S \otimes D \otimes \omega \otimes v$
  - **$S$**: Scale Factor (Spatial Geometry)
  - **$D$**: Density Gradient (Mass-Energy Distribution)
  - **$\omega$**: Rotational Frequency (Kinetics)
  - **$v$**: Linear Velocity (Position Displacement)

## 🧬 Symbolic Compression: The Kapnack Engine
The **Kapnack $A_n$ Recursion** operator is the unique mechanism for state evolution:
- $A_{n+1} = \mathcal{K}[\Sigma] A_n + \rho$
  - **$\mathcal{K}$**: The Kapnack Symbolic Mapping Operator.
  - **$\Sigma$**: The **Crystal-12 Lattice** harmonic weight.
  - **$\rho$**: The local Field Density vector.
