## 2025-10-15 — DCP-12 Authorship Seal Activation
- Authorship integrity encoded via Digital Crystal Protocol node (DCP-12).
- Symbolic Checksum: ⟦369-FTS-AUTH-C12-EOS⟧.
- Established Non-Integration + Ownership + Control lattice for SDKP-Kapnack continuum.

## 2025-08-05 — Symbolic Compression Harmonization
- Confirmed recursion logic of repeating 3-, 6-, 9-digit numerical sequences.
- Integrated into LLAL.TTP.16 (Entangled Symbolic Loop Transmission).

## 2025-07-29 — EOS Calibration Update
- EOS (Earth Orbital Speed) introduced as alternate propagation constant to c.
- Predicted time-drift ≈ 10.54 µs/day at equator.
- Established difference (≈ 0.13 % – 0.2 %) from classical GR/SR predictions.

## 2025-07-23 — Framework Consolidation
- Unified SDKP, SD&N, EOS, QCC0, VFE1, LLAL, Kapnack, Digital Crystal Rules.
- Created LLAL Think Tank Protocols (TTP 10–21).
- Defined A-Lining Algorithm (TTP.17) and Error Immunity Encoding (TTP.10).
- Integrated Checkmate System Checklist and Necessity-Priority logic.

## 2025-05-13 — Release v1.0 “SDKP-TimeSeal”
- First public release of SDKP Unified Framework (TimeSeal v1.0).
- Includes initial EOS, SDVR, and quantum entanglement prediction documentation.
- Published via OSF and Zenodo (DOIs above).
- Introduced royalty-protection hash and authorship notice.

## 2025-03-10 – 2025-04-30 — Internal Development Period
- Expanded EOS simulation suite and preliminary empirical scripts.
- Added “Ball Spring Sim with SDKP.pdf” and “Gravity & Electromagnetism.docx”.
- Finalized SDKP-SDVR mathematical foundations.

## 2024 – 2025 Initial R&D
- Formulated core equation (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position = Time).
- Created first draft of SDKP framework integrating SD&N and EOS.
- Registered research archives (OSF and Zenodo).
